# LocX 🧠⚡
## The Neural Network Behind Event Discovery

> **"We don't build event apps. We build the intelligence that makes events discoverable."**

LocX is semantic search infrastructure for the fragmented cultural ecosystem. Think AWS for event discovery, Stripe for cultural transactions, Redis for semantic search.

---

## 🎯 What We Build

**Not an events app.** The intelligence layer that powers event discovery.

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language → structured understanding
- **Multi-source Aggregation**: 20+ platforms → unified intelligence
- **Vector Embeddings**: BERT → 768-dimensional event understanding
- **Real-time Inference**: <100ms query → result pipeline

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Animations**: GSAP + Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **3D**: Blender → glTF/GLB
- **Deployment**: Vercel + CDN

```

---

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **First Contentful Paint**: <1.5s
- **3D Animations**: 60fps desktop, 30fps mobile
- **Lighthouse Score**: >90
- **Core Web Vitals**: Green across all metrics

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**"Neural Network Aesthetics"**

- **Colors**: Deep blacks (`#0a0a0a`), electric greens (`#00ff88`), cyan blues (`#00ccff`)
- **Typography**: Mono for code/tech, Sans for human elements
- **3D Elements**: Abstract neural networks, data flows, semantic graphs
- **Interactions**: Cursor-reactive particles, morphing on hover
